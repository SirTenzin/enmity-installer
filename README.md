# Enmity Installer

<img src="https://cdn.upload.systems/uploads/G5KCboAo.png">

The Enmity Installer is an electron app that plans to sideload the official Enmity IPA for iOS.
Currently EI does nothing, it is merely a front page for the installer.

# Usage (unworking software)

Run the following commands to compile and run the electron app.

```
npm install || yarn
npm start || yarn start
```

# To Do:

- [ ] Implement a silent CLI based sideloader (perhaps using Sideloadly)
